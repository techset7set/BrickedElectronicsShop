SHOPPING CART DAY

    So, we already have User model
        USER
        id  name    email   admin   activated
        
    cart model
        CART
        id  FK(user_id)
        
        Belongs to relation ship (one-to-one) with user
        belongs to user
        Has many line_items
        
    product model
        PRODUCT
        id  image_url(?)    title   desc
        
        belongs to line_item (has many)
        
    Product doesn't belogn to cart, so we need a joining table
        LINE ITEM
        id  FK(cart_id) FK(product_id)
        
        belongs to cart
        
-------
1)generate model(s)
    & migrate
2)generate controller(s)
    create User listing at signup and Cart Item
    users#create -> @user.cart = Cart.create;
        carts#create -> @cart = current_user.cart.build; @cart.save;
