sessions vs cookies
    sessions don't save between page openings
    cookies aren't secure
        create random string of digits -> "remember token"
        hash digest of token in our db as a one-way hash
        encrypt userID & put into cookie

        //db/migrate
    
    > rails generate migration add_remember_digest rememger_digest:string
